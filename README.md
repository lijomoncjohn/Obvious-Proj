Android Image gallery application with Pictures from Nasa

Implemented gallery page and details page.
Used navigation drawer. \
Image details page is slidable across all available images along with details.
Seleted image from gallery page will took forward to the same item.


Could've been don better with API rather than static Json file.
Tried to parse Json data from Assets folder which is failed due to Json mismatches. The Json starts with array.
Same issue occured while fetching from Shared Preferences using Gson.
